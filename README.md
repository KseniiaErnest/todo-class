<h1>Todo List Project<h1/>
<h4>This project is a simple Todo List application where I practice using React class components. The app allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Also it is possible to filter tasks by status "All", "Active", "Completed". It serves as a learning exercise to get familiar with the concepts of state, props, and lifecycle methods in React class components. The project's design and resources like images, svg were taken from <a href='https://www.frontendmentor.io/'>Fronted Mentor</a> as one of their challenges.
